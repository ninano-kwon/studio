- Accent color: Energetic orange (#FFB347), analogous to blue, for highlighting key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable, and accessible design. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a set of minimalist icons for navigation and feature representation. Icons should be simple, geometric, and filled, with rounded corners.

- Employ subtle animations for transitions and interactive elements, such as button presses and content reveals. Animations should be smooth and responsive, enhancing the user experience without being distracting.
